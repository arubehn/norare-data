This dataset was submitted along with the [STARLING software]() by [Starostin (2000)](:bib:Starostin2000a). Unfortunately, the original description of the purpose of this file has been lost from the web. Originally, the data was used to determine semantic matches between words in order to find a first set of comparanda for the purpose of cognate detection. The basic idea was, according to the original description, to compare two glosses by their "senses", which is a list of tags assigned to each concept.
