# Plotting example for simple correlation tests in NoRaRe

## Requirements

Make sure to have `pynorare` installed, and to have downloaded `norare-data`. 

```
$ pip install -i requirements.txt
```

## Running the script

```
$ python plot.py
```

The script picks two columns from the NoRaRe data, and correlates them, using spearman and pearson correlation functions. To modify the values and datasets, just modify the respective variables in the script.
