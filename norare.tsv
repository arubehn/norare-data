Alonso-2015-AoA	SPANISH_AOA_MEAN	mean	AoA	ratings	user		Average score of AoA ratings.
Alonso-2015-AoA	SPANISH_AOA_MIN	numeric	AoA	ratings	user		The minimum age of acquisition indicated by participants.
Alonso-2015-AoA	SPANISH_AOA_MAX	numeric	AoA	ratings	user		The maximum age of acquisition indicated by participants.
Alonso-2015-AoA	SPANISH_ORAL_FREQUENCY_LOG	logarithmic	frequency	norms	corpus	Alonso2011	Oral frequency norms from Alonso et al. (2011).
Brysbaert-2009-Frequency	ENGLISH_FREQUENCY	tokens	frequency	norms	corpus		The number of times the word appears in the corpus (i.e., on the total of 51 million words).
Brysbaert-2009-Frequency	ENGLISH_CD	tokens	contextual diversity	norms	corpus		The number of films in which the word appears (i.e., it has a maximum value of 8,388).
Brysbaert-2009-Frequency	ENGLISH_SUBTITLE_FREQUENCY	numeric	frequency	norms	corpus		The word frequency per million words. It is the measure one would preferably use in ones manuscripts, because it is a standard measure of word frequency independent of the corpus size. It is given with two-digit precision, in order not to lose precision of the frequency counts.
Brysbaert-2009-Frequency	ENGLISH_SUBTITLE_CD	numeric	contextual diversity	norms	corpus		This  indicates in what percentage of the films the word appears.
Brysbaert-2009-Frequency	ENGLISH_FREQUENCY_LOG	logarithmic	frequency	norms	corpus		This value is based on log10(FREQcount+1) and has four-digit precision. Calculating the log frequency on the raw frequencies is the most straightforward transformation, because it allows one to give words that are not in the corpus a value of 0. One can easily lose 5% of the variance explained by taking log(frequency per million # 1), because, in this case, one is not making much of a distinction between words with low frequencies. Similarly, adding values lower than 1 (e.g., #1E#10) is dangerous, because one may end up with a big gap between the words in one√ïs corpus and words for which one does not have a frequency measure (which will get a log value of #10). In addition, if one uses log(frequency per million), one will have negative values for words with a frequency lower than 1 per million, and one will have to enter negative values for missing words. The downside of using log10(FREQcount # 1) is that there is no intuitive relationship between Lg10WF and SUBTLWF (frequency per million).
Brysbaert-2009-Frequency	ENGLISH_CD_LOG	logarithmic	contextual diversity	norms	corpus		This value is based on log10(CDcount+1) and has four-digit precision.

Brysbaert-2011-Frequency	GERMAN_FREQUENCY_LOG	logarithmic	frequency	norms	corpus		This is log10(CUMfreqcount+1). It is the value to use when you want to match stimuli in various conditions. When a stimulus is not present in the corpus, lgSUBTLEX gets a value of 0.

It is given with two-digit precision, in order not to lose precision of the frequency counts.
Cai-2010-Frequency	CHINESE_FREQUENCY_LOG	logarithmic	frequency	norms	corpus		This value is based on log10(FREQcount+1) and has four-digit precision. Calculating the log frequency on the raw frequencies is the most straightforward transformation, because it allows one to give words that are not in the corpus a value of 0.
