Brysbaert-2009-60384		ENGLISH	0	string	linguistic					English (American)	corpus	word	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		To help users, this is written with a capital whenever the frequency of the lowercase word is smaller than half of the total frequency. This is the case for nearly one word in six. Words with capitals include all the words that are used more often as a name than as a content word (e.g., Mark, Bay), words with a frequency of 1 or 2 that happened to be the first word of a sentence (e.g., Workwise, Unverifiable), and words that in general tend to occur at the beginning of a sentence (e.g., According, Thanks).
Brysbaert-2009-60384		FREQUENCY	1	integer	numeric		2	2134713	frequency	English (American)	corpus	FREQcount	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This is the number of times the word appears in the corpus (i.e., on the total of 51 million words).
Brysbaert-2009-60384		CONTEXTUAL_DIVERSITY	2	integer	numeric		1	8388		English (American)	corpus	CDcount	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This is the number of films in which the word appears (i.e., it has a maximum value of 8,388).
Brysbaert-2009-60384		FREQLOW	3	integer	numeric		0	1595028	frequency	English (American)	corpus	FREQlow	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This is the number of times the word appears in the corpus starting with a lowercase letter. This allows users to further match their stimuli.
Brysbaert-2009-60384		CDLOW	4	integer	numeric		0	8388		English (American)	corpus	CDlow	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This is the number of films in which the word appears starting with a lowercase letter.
Brysbaert-2009-60384		SUBTITLE_WORD_FREQUENCY	5	float	numeric		0.04	41857.12	frequency	English (American)	corpus	SUBTLWF	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This is the word frequency per million words. It is the measure one would preferably use in one’s manuscripts, because it is a standard measure of word frequency independent of the corpus size. It is given with two-digit precision, in order not to lose precision of the frequency counts.
Brysbaert-2009-60384		LG10WF	6	float	logarithmic		0.4771	6.3293	frequency	English (American)	corpus	Lg10WF	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This value is based on log10(FREQcount#1) and has four-digit precision. Calculating the log frequency on the raw frequencies is the most straightforward transformation, because it allows one to give words that are not in the corpus a value of 0. One can easily lose 5% of the variance explained by taking log(frequency per million # 1), because, in this case, one is not making much of a distinction between words with low frequencies. Similarly, adding values lower than 1 (e.g., #1E#10) is dangerous, because one may end up with a big gap between the words in one’s corpus and words for which one does not have a frequency measure (which will get a log value of #10). In addition, if one uses log(frequency per million), one will have negative values for words with a frequency lower than 1 per million, and one will have to enter negative values for missing words. The downside of using log10(FREQcount # 1) is that there is no intuitive relationship between Lg10WF and SUBTLWF (frequency per million).
Brysbaert-2009-60384		SUBTITLE_CONTEXTUAL_DIVERSITY	7	float	numeric		0.01	100	frequency	English (American)	corpus	SUBTLCD	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This value indicates in what percentage of the films the word appears. For instance, the word *the* has a SUBTLCD of 100.00, because it occurs in each film. In contrast, the word *abbreviation* has a SUBTLCD of 0.10, because it appears only in eight films. This value has two-digit precision in order not to lose information.
Brysbaert-2009-60384	https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BRM.41.4.977	LG10CD	8	float	logarithmic		0.301	3.9237	frequency	English (American)	corpus	Lg10CD	brysbaert_word_frequencies.csv		This value is based on log10(CDcount # 1) and has four-digit precision. As the present article has shown, this is the best value to use if one wants to match words on word frequency.
